Good morning, everyone. Today, we're here to discuss the testing strategies for our Zil Banks software project. As the project leader, I want to ensure that our testing efforts are comprehensive and effective in delivering a high-quality banking software. Let's start by reviewing our testing goals and approaches.

We need to prioritize testing the core functionalities of our banking software, including account management, transactions, and security features. Additionally, we must ensure compliance with banking regulations and standards to guarantee the safety and reliability of our software.

Automated testing will play a crucial role in speeding up our testing process and ensuring consistent results. We'll focus on creating a robust suite of automated tests for critical functionalities, such as user authentication, fund transfers, and account balance calculations.

Manual testing will complement our automated tests by allowing us to explore edge cases, user interfaces, and user experience aspects of the software. We'll assign manual testing tasks to ensure thorough coverage and identify any usability issues or inconsistencies.

For our testing tasks, I propose the following assignments:

Rahul will be responsible for setting up and maintaining our automated testing framework. He'll work on creating test scripts, running automated tests, and analyzing test results.

Joy will lead our manual testing efforts, focusing on functional testing, usability testing, and exploratory testing. He'll be responsible for creating test cases, executing tests, and reporting any defects or issues.

Joseph will handle regression testing and integration testing. He'll ensure that new changes and features don't break existing functionality and that different components of the software work together seamlessly.

Additionally, each team member will collaborate closely with the development team to provide timely feedback and address any issues or bugs discovered during testing. Our goal is to maintain a continuous testing process throughout the development lifecycle to catch defects early and deliver a reliable banking software to our customers.

Thank you all for your dedication and contributions to this project. Let's work together to ensure the success of Zil Banks.
now from the above text prepare an Array of objects named test where the name of the worker the assigned test is given ,the assigned test must be given in a concise manner with minimum words. 
prepare a array of text containing the various testing strategies required and must be like unit testing whitebox testing etc... with more technical terms included but must be from the conversation

a variable that gives the amount of time required for testing 
return all this in json format
